# ice-bridge

Dropbox Archiver written in Go

## Getting Started

Install Go and setup your [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).
Once your go environment is up and running you can build the project locally using

```shell
go build
```

Then you can run it from the current directory using
```shell
./ice-bridge
```

You can also compile the binary and place it in your `$GOPATH/bin` using

```shell
go install
```

Then you can simply type
```shell
ice-bridge
```
to run the application.
